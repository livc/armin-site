我们经常会为某个命令设置 alias，比如我在 zsh 中设置了 

```bash
alias diff="icdiff"
```

([icdiff](https://github.com/jeffkaufman/icdiff) 是一个加强版的 diff)

```bash
➜  which diff
diff: aliased to icdiff
➜  diff
Usage: icdiff [options] left_file right_file

Show differences between files in a two column view.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
……
```

如果想暂时忽略 alias，使用系统自带的 diff，则可以在前面加上 `command` 命令：

```bash
➜  command diff --help
Usage: diff [OPTION]... FILES
Compare files line by line.

  -i  --ignore-case  Ignore case differences in file contents.
  --ignore-file-name-case  Ignore case when comparing file names.
……
```
